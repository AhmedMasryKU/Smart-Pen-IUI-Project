# Smart-Pen-IUI-Project

Smart Pen is a project that enables the
user to use a normal pen and a blank A4 paper
instead of a stylish pen to capture hand-written
texts and drawings using the webcam of his/her
laptop as the input device. It alleviates the
burden of buying the expensive stylish pen and
the board.

This was the final project of the course Intelligent User Interfaces(Comp437) in Koc University.
